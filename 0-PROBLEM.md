## Problem

1. I want to keep a digital diary.
1. Finding time and remembering to write every day is hard.
1. Writing should be practical.
1. I want to be able read it in next 50 years.
1. I worry about privacy.
1. There's not an open and exportable format between existing diary-keeping apps.
1. Diary keeping apps are non-free and there's no guarantee that developers will keep maintaining such apps. They do not care if my data will sustain.
